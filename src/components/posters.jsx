              <p>For the first time since the pandemic, the ARVOS workshop will bring together bring together active research groups and key industry players to discuss the latest technological advances related to ophthalmic procedures. Researchers, clinicians, companies, and students will discuss the current state of the art as well as future plans in both research and translation. </p>
              <p>For this reason, the IROS-ARVOS Program Committee is seeking high quality abstracts describing research findings in the areas covered by the workshop, which include robotic microsurgery, intraoperative visualization, image-guided surgery, task automation in ophthalmic surgery, and surgical sonification.</p>
              <p>Submitted abstracts will be peer-reviewed and must include a clear statement of the hypothesis, an explanation of the methods, and a report of data that clearly support the hypothesis, as well as a brief discussion of its implications.</p>
              <p>The selected abstracts will be invited to prepare a poster to be presented and discussed at the IROS-ARVOS workshop.</p>
              <p>The guidelines for the abstract submission can be seen in the <a href="abstract.pdf">attached document</a>.</p>
              <p>The submission deadline is September 15th (11:59pm ET).</p>
